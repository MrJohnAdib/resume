# MrAdib Resume

The Resume of Javad Adib

I want to create new resume and decide to create this repository to share it with you!

## Installation

Simply fork this repository, then try to update html file.
If you want to change style, yout need to run tailwind cli with below command

`npm run build`

If you're using windows maybe you get below error

`'NODE_ENV' is not recognized as an internal or external command`

So, try to install win node env with below command

`npm install -g win-node-env`

So it works! well done.
